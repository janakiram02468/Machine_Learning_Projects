# Machine_Learning_Projects

Here i did some all simple machine learning projects

I covered all the Machine Learning Algorithms such as 
1. Linear Regression,
2. Logistic Regression,
3. KMeans, 
4. KNN, 
5. Decision Tree, 
6. Random Forest, 
7. Support Vector Machine, 
8. Naive Bayes, 
9. Principle Component Analysis
10. MLP

And also Time Series Analysis i.e ARIMA Model, Elbow Method to find cluster, visualization for Decision Tree etc.

Soo, here i have given data files, jupyter notebook files and also Python files.

Better to choose jupyter notebook files because we can know the process each and every step.
